<p>What is Internet?</p>
<p>The Internet (International Network) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing. </p>

<h1 id="origin">Origins of Internet</h1>
<p>The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life. </p>

<h1 id="Infrastructure">Infrastructure</h1>
<p>The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of its hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture. As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of internetworking, many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across heterogeneous hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.

<h1 id="Uses">Uses</h1>
<ul>
<li>Electronic mail: At least 85% of the inhabitants of cyberspace send and receive e-mail. 
    <br>Some 20 million e-mail messages cross the Internet every week.
</li>
<br>
<li>Electronic newspapers and magazines. This category includes late-breaking news, weather, and sports. 
    <br> Weâ€™re likely to see this category leap to the top five in the next several years.</li>
    <br>
<li>Education:
    Most of the devices nowadays are connected through the Internet. The Internet has the availability of broad educational content on any topic with different types.
    <br> People can study the relevant topic just by spending a couple of minutes over the Internet. 
     Internet Search engines help people quickly find the relevant study material in multiple formats (such as images, videos, documents, etc.).</li>
    <br>
<li>Social Networking:
    Social networking sites have connected people around the world. Social networking is an essential part of the Internet. 
    <br>With the help of the Internet, people have got the ability to form social groups where they can share information, thoughts and ideas about anything. 
    <br>The social networking platform is the largest source of content, covering everything from informative content to entertainment.</li>
<br>
<li>Entertainment:
    The Internet is the most effective means of entertainment. There are various options available on the Internet, which people can try, such as watching movies, playing online games, listening to songs, etc.
